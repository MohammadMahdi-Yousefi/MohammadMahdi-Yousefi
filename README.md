## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>I am a Junior Front-End Developer seeking new web design challenges. My interest lies in developing
websites using the React JS framework, and I enjoy being an active and responsible team player. I am
always eager to learn new skills and explore different opportunities to better myself. I have excellent
communication skills and can easily connect with people. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer
Engineering. I have completed various programming courses, which has deepened my passion for coding
and designing web pages. </p>
